refactor, over 20 years old codes
   even 20 years a go, the style was already old fashioned.
   (1) many globals to be eliminated
       *memoized-module* ?
   (2) clean up and reorganize modules
       profiler -- new
       context
   (3) many dumplicated/similar code fragments
       much codes have been added in ad hoc manner

update manual.tex for current interpreter, add/remove options

ship parametrized modules in lib/para/ like 
	para/list.cafe
	para/queue.cafe
	para/set.cafe
so that one can use
	require para/list.cafe
	pr(PARA_LIST(NAT))
	pr(PARA_SET(NAT))
	...

we should add a check that a key is not define'd more than once
my idea was to add code to oldoc.lisp as the generate-oldoc- is
called on all values, but the following patch didn't generate
any warnings:
-       (setf (gethash key *cafeobj-alias-db*) mainkey)))
+        (multiple-value-bind (hk pr) (gethash key *cafeobj-alias-db*)
+         (format t "DEBUG DEBUG DEBUG defining ~s" key)
+         (if pr
+           (error "multiple defines of ~s" key))
+         (setf hk mainkey))))

How about not to specify --dynamic-space-size at image creation time?

It would be nice if we can specify this at the time of invoking cafeobj.
According to the sbcl manual (ver. 1.2.1), there is a way to do this.
(1) specifying the argument ':save-runtime-options nil' to 'save-lisp-and-die'
(2) calls cafeobj executable like this
     cafeobj --dynamic-space-size XXXX --end-runtime-options
--end-toplevel-options <args-to-cafeobj>*
(Please refer to 3.2.3 Saving Core Image and 3.3 Command Line Options
of the manual. )
