we should add a check that a key is not define'd more than once
my idea was to add code to oldoc.lisp as the generate-oldoc- is
called on all values, but the following patch didn't generate
any warnings:
-       (setf (gethash key *cafeobj-alias-db*) mainkey)))
+        (multiple-value-bind (hk pr) (gethash key *cafeobj-alias-db*)
+         (format t "DEBUG DEBUG DEBUG defining ~s" key)
+         (if pr
+           (error "multiple defines of ~s" key))
+         (setf hk mainkey))))

How about not to specify --dynamic-space-size at image creation time?

It would be nice if we can specify this at the time of invoking cafeobj.
According to the sbcl manual (ver. 1.2.1), there is a way to do this.
(1) specifying the argument ':save-runtime-options nil' to 'save-lisp-and-die'
(2) calls cafeobj executable like this
     cafeobj --dynamic-space-size XXXX --end-runtime-options
--end-toplevel-options <args-to-cafeobj>*
(Please refer to 3.2.3 Saving Core Image and 3.3 Command Line Options
of the manual. )
