* CafeOBJ 1.5.2
===============

  - Fixes to the wrapper to work with spaces in the path
  - make 'ls' command work on Windows (but not UNC path)

* CafeOBJ 1.5.1
===============

  Fixes for Windows packages to be run from UNC paths

* CafeOBJ 1.5.0
===============

  Several changes have been done over years, we summarize only a few:

  - introduction of a large family of search predicates for state/transition
    based specifications (see `search predicates' in the online help or
    manual)
  - addition of a (nearly) complete reference manual (reference-manual.pdf)
  - addition of CITP-like proving tool 
    (see http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~danielmg/citp.html for the original version)
  - revised build system, allows for building and running CafeOBJ based
    on several lisp engines
  - improved online help system with search functionality (see `?' `?ap' etc)
  - build support has been stream-lined, currently supported Common Lisp
    implementations are SBCL, CLISP, Allegro CL
  - ...

* many unmentioned releases

* CafeOBJ 1.4.3PigNose
=======================
  a resolution based proof eningine PigNose.

* Changes in CafeOBJ 1.4.3
===========================
  various minor bug fixes

* Changes in CafeOBJ 1.4.2b10
=============================

** new `check' command 
   check { coherency | coherence | coh } [ <OpName> ]

   checks if operator is behaviouraly coherent

* Changes in CafeOBJ 1.4.2b9
============================

** switch `fast parse' is obsolete

* Changes in CafeOBJ 1.4.2b4
============================

** switch `mel always' now properly works for `parse' command.

** supports qulifying operator symbols by module name in terms.

** faster version of term parser for ad-hoc overloading operators.
   relating top-level switch: `fast parse', default on.

** made nesting limit of evaluating condition part. this prevents
   unexpected break in underlying Lisp system for many of the cases.
   related switch: `cond limit', accepting `.'(no limit) and positive
   integer. defaults value varies among underlying lisp.

* Changes in CafeOBJ 1.4.2b2
============================

** Specifying views to parameters are easier for modules like:
   
      mod FOO (X :: TH1, Y :: TH2(X)) { ... }

* Changes in CafeOBJ 1.4.2b1
============================
This version has some experimental new features and several bug
fixes.

** In addition to Gnu Common Lisp, CMU Common Lisp and Allegro Common Lisp
   can be used as a platform (see README and INSTALL for detail).

** Faster rewrite engine `brute' is now available, and can be invoked from 
   CafeOBJ.

** Behavioural axioms can be used in equational reduction, and an operator
   attribute `coherent' is added for this purpose.

** A behavioural reduction command is introduced.

** Sort predicates (a partial MEL support) are introduced (experimental).

Unfortunately, full implementation of `record' construct is not yet
finished in this version.
