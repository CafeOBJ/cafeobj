;;; PROCEDUREs for CZ Matching =================================================

;;;  CZ: commutativity with identity
;;;


;; The idea is that there are only two possible matches for any 
;; pair of commutative terms - 11 and 22, or 12 and 21.  Since we
;; may actually get a system of multiple equations, we have to 
;; generate all possible pairings.
;;
;; Also, we check for identity binding possibilities for each of the 
;; four immediate subterms.  Thus there are 4 possible match sub-equations
;; where one term is dropped, and 4 possible match sub-equations where
;; two terms are dropped.
;;
;; current understanding is that the cases with two terms dropped
;; due to identity are not needed, since e.g. 4 = 4*1   must be 
;; handled by the matching algorithm anyway.
