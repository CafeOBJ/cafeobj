;;; NOTE:
;;; It would be certainly more efficient to built in the empty theory in
;;; the mutation process of a (non empty) theory.

;;; Implementation

;;; An empty state consists into a system and a flag 0 or 1. 
;;; 0 means that the state is a new one and that one as to decompose the system.
;;; 1 means that the decomposition has been already done and that there is 
;;; no more next state

;;; INITIALIZATION

;;; Initialize an empty state. It check if the top symbols of each equation of
;;; the system have the same head function.
