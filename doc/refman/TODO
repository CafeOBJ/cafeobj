Definition of reduction and interpretation of variables of
      RD =def "S =( , )=> P suchThat C withStateEq E {I}"

(a) Let {V1, V2, ...,Vn} =def (vars(P) \setminus vars(S)).
(a.1) Treat variables in
  ((vars(S) U vars(P) U vars (C) U vars(I))
     \setminus {V1, V2, ...,Vn})
  as fresh constants.
(a.2) Treat variables in {V1, V2, ...,Vn} as "variables"
  for making bindings.
(a.3) (vars(E) = {S1,S2}) and
      ((((vars(S) U vars(P) U vars (C) U vars(I))
         \setintersection(\cap) {S1,S2}) = \emptyset);
     S1 and S2 are variables for indicating two arguments of a
     predicate over sort(S) (=sort(P))

(b) The reduction of RD works as follows.
    Search next term T such that (S =( , )=> T).
    E is used for terminating the search for T.
    Do the followings for each T.
(b.1) Get all bindings b1,b2,...,bm such that (bi(P) = T).
           where bi = {V1->t1, V2->t2, ..., Vn->tn}
(b.2) Output (to the standard output stream) the binding bi and the term
　　　bi(I) if (bi(C) = true).

(C) The returned value of RD is defined as follows
    if the reduction of RD terminates.
(c.1) Return "true" if there exits some term T such that (S =( , )=> T)
 and ((bi(C) = true) for some binding bi).
(C.2) Return "false" otherwise.
