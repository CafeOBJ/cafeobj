;;; flatten-list
;;;  flattens list L, i.e., returns a single list containing the
;;;   same atoms as L but with any internal lists 'dissolved'.
;;; For example,
;;;   (flatten-list '(a (b c) d))  ==>  (a b c d)
;;; Recursively flattens components of L, according to the following rules:
;;;    - an atom is already flattened.
;;;    - a list whose CAR is also a list is flattened by appending the
;;;      flattened CAR to the flattened CDR (this is what dissolves internal
;;;      lists).
;;;    - a list whose CAR is an atom is flattened by just flattening the CDR
;;;      and CONSing the original CAR onto the result.
;;; These rules were chosen with some attention to minimizing CONSing."
