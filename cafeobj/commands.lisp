`reduce`, `exec`, `print`
  ~ the operation acts on the (sub)term specified by `<range>` and
    `<selection>`. 

rewrite rule
  ~ in this case a rewrite rule spec has to be given in the following
    form:

    `[+|-][<mod_name>].<rule-id>`

    where `<mod_name>` is the name of a module, and `<rule-id>` either
    a number n - in which case the n. equation in the current module
    is used, or the label of an equation. If the `<mod_name>` is not
    given, the equations of the current module are considered. If the
    leading `+` or no leading character is given, the equation is
    applied left-to-right, which with a leading `-` the equation is
    applied right-to-left.

The `<subst>` is of the form

`with { <var_name> = <term> } +,`

and is used when applying a rewrite rule. In this case the variables
in the rule are bound to the given term.

`<range>` is either `within` or `at`. In the former case the action is
applied at or inside the (sub)term specified by the following
selection. In the later case it means exactly at the (sub)term.

Finally, the `<selection>` is an expression

`<selector> { of <selector> } *`

where each `<selector>` is one of

`top`, `term`
  ~ Selects the whole term

`subterm`
  ~ Selects the pre-chosen subterm (see [`choose`](#choose))

`( <number_list> )`
  ~ A list of numbers separated by blanks as in `(2 1)` indicates a 
    subterm by tree search. `(2 1)` means the first argument of the
    second argument.

`[ <number1> .. <number2> ]`
  ~ This selector can only be used with associative operators. It
    indicates a subterm in a flattened structure and selects the
    subterm between and including the two numbers given. `[n .. n]`
    can be abbreviated to `[n]`. 

    Example: If the term is `a * b * c * d * e`, then the 
    expression `[2 .. 4]` selects the subterm `b * c * d`.

`{ <number_set> }`
  ~ This selector can only be used with associative and commutative
  operators. It indicates a subterm in a multiset structure obtained
  from selecting the subterms at position given by the numbers.

  Example: If the operator `_*_` is declared as associative and
  commutative, and the current term is `b * c * d * c * e`, then
  then the expression `{2, 4, 5}` selects the subterm `c * c * e`."

Spaces around the `=` are necessary to separate the left from
the right hand side. The terms given must belong to the
same connected component in the graph defined by the sort ordering.

In simple words, the objects determined by the terms must be
interpretable as of the same sort.

The optional part `<label-exp>` serves two purposes, one is to give
an axiom an identifier, and one is to modify its behavior. The
`<label-exp>` is of the form:

` [ <modifier> <label> ] : `

Warning: The square brackets here are *not* specifying optional
components, but syntactical elements. Thus, a labeled axiom
can look like:

`eq[foobar] : foo = bar .`

The `<modifier>` part is used to change the rewriting behavior of
the axiom.  There are at the moment two possible 
modifiers, namely `:m-and (:m-and-also)` and `:m-or (:m-or-else)`.
Both make sense only for operators where the arguments come from an 
associative sort.
In this case both modifiers create all possible permutations
of the arguments and rewrite the original term to the conjunction
in case of `:m-and` or to the disjunction in case of `:m-or` of all
the generated terms.

Assume that `NatSet` is a sort with associative constructor modeling
a set of natural number, and let

`````
  pred p1: Nat .
  ops q1 q2 : NatSet -> Bool .
  eq [:m-and]: q1(N1:Nat NS:NatSet) = p1(N1) .
  eq [:m-or]:  q2(N1:Nat NS:NatSet) = p1(N1) .
`````

In this case an expression like `q1(1 2 3)` would reduce to 
`p1(1) and p1(2) and p1(3)` (modulo AC), and `q2(1 2 3)` into
the same term with `or` instead."

instantiation binds actual parameters to formal parameters. The result
of an instantiation is a new module, obtained by replacing occurrences
of parameter sorts and operators by their actual counterparts. If, as
a result of instantiation, a module is imported twice, it is assumed
to be imported once and shared throughout.

Instantiation is done by

`<module_name> ( <bindings> )`

where `<module_name>` is the name of a parameterized module, and
`<bindings>` is a comma-separated list of binding constructs.

using declared views
  ~ you may bind an already declared view to a parameter:
    
    `<parameter> <= <view_name>`

    If a module `M` has a parameter `X :: T` and a view `V` from `T`
    to `M'` is declared, `V` may be bound to `X`, with the effect that

    1. The sort and operator names of `T` that appear in the body
       of `M` are replaced by those in `M'`, in accordance with `V`,

    2. The common submodules of `M` and `M'` are shared.

using ephemeral views
  ~ In this case the view is declared and used at the same time.

    `<parameter> <= view to <mod_name> { <view_elements> }`

    See [`view`](#view) for details concerning `<view_elements>`. The
    `from` parameter in the `view` declaration is taken from
    `<parameter>`.


To make notation more succinct, parameters can be identified also by
position instead of names as in

`<mod_name> ( <view_name>, <view_name> )`

which would bind the `<view_name>`s to the respective parameters
of the parameterized module `<mod_name>`.

This can be combined with the ephemeral definition of a view like in
the following example (assume `ILIST` has two parameters):

~~~~~
module NAT-ILIST {
  protecting ( ILIST(SIMPLE-NAT { sort Elt -> Nat },
                     DATATYPE   { sort Elt -> Data }) )

`prec: <int>`

    Smaller precedence values designate stronger binding. See
    [operator precedence](#opprec) for details of the predefined
    operator precedence values.

`l-assoc` and `r-assoc`

  right-associative

`constr`

`strat: ( <int-list> )`

    `op if_then_else_fi : Bool Int Int -> Int { strat: (1 0) }`

Remarks:

  - Several operators of the same arity/coarity can be defined by
    using `ops` instead of `op`:

    `ops f g : S -> S`

    For the case of mixfix operators the underbars have to be given
    and the expression surrounded by parenthesis:

    `ops (_+_) (_*_) : S S -> S`

  - Spaces *can* be part of the operator name, thus an operator 
  definition of `op foo op : S -> S` is valid, but not advisable,
  as parsing needs hints.

  - `S =(n,m)=>* SS [if Pred]` search states reachable by 0 or more transitions;
  - `S =(n,m)=>+ SS [if Pred]` search states reachable by 1 or more transitions;
  - `S =(n,m)=>! SS [if Pred]` search states reachable by 0 or more transitions, and
    require that the reached state is a final state, i.e., no further
    transitions can be applied.

To allow for conditional transitions, a transition is only considered
in the search if `Pred` holds.

The parameters `n` and `m` in these search predicates:

  - `n`, a natural number or `*`, gives the maximal number of solutions
     to be searched. If `*` is given all solutions are searched
     exhaustively.
  - `m`, a natural number but not `*`, gives the maximal depth up to
     which search is performed.

The predicates return true if there is a (chain of) transitions
that fits the parameters (`n`,`m`, and `*`, `+`, `!`) and connects `S`
with `SS`.

There are two orthogonal extension to this search predicate, one
adds a `suchThat` clause, one adds a `withStateEq` clause.

`S =(n,m)=>* SS [if Pred1] suchThat Pred2`
  ~ (and similar for `!` and `+`) In this case not only the existence,
    of a transition sequence is tested, but also whether the predicate
    `Pred2`, which normally takes `S` and `SS` as arguments, holds.

`S =(n,m)=>* SS [if Pred1] withStateEq Pred2`
  ~ (and similar for `!` and `+`) `Pred2` is used to determine whether
    a search continues at `SS` or not, by comparing `SS` with all
    states that have been traversed in the current search. If the
    predicate `Pred2` returns true on the combination of `SS` as
    first argument, and any of the previously visited states as
    second argument, then the search is *not* continued after `SS`.

  themselves;

2. If the source and target modules have sorts and/or operators with
